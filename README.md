<!-- Additional Features
For Project 3, my additional features I have added is showing the old movie genre category in the edit event page as a disabled option, so that a new category would be selected when editing to avoid confusion.
Progress & Challenges
-	The status of Project 3 at this point is complete. I have no remaining portions to complete for this assignment, so consider this submission as complete and valid. I had very few issues with Mongoose and integrating the schema into my app but I managed to fix them when I realized it was similar to the exercises so it became easier to implement.
-	The easy parts of the assignment was creating the converting the model to a new schema and exporting the model, but the most difficult part was modifying the controller to allow CRUD to follow Mongoose methods, routes, and models, but it was done with perseverance and I am glad I am finished with the project. -->
